 * The {@link VariableClassOrder} contains variable classes which are explored by the genetic algorithm during the

 * <p>
 * Only variables assignable from classes found in the {@link VariableClassOrder} are used by the genetic algorithm. The
 * assignment of variables which are not assignable from the classes in the {@link VariableClassOrder} (in this case,
 * the indexOf() method returns {@code -1}) is not explored, but instead chosen solely by the SAT-solver.
 * <p>
 * During the SAT-solving, variables that are assignable from classes with a lower index in the
 * {@link VariableClassOrder} are set before variables with a higher index, while variables which are not assignable at
 * all are set at the very end.
