Exemplary input and output files for Task Graphs For Free (TGFF)[1] to generate application graph and resource types database that can be parsed using ReaderTGFF.java in opendse-io. 

*.tgffopt           input required by TGFF - adapt this to create new applications/architectures

*.eps and *.vcg     TGFF output for visualizing generated graphs (not required for opendse import)
*.tgff              TGFF output that can be parsed by ReaderTGFF.java. Examples from the Embedded Systems Synthesis Benchmark Suite (E3S)[2] are also available in this format and can be imported directly.
