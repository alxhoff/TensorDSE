# Mapping DSE

The target problem of mapping an inference graph to a heterogeneous system with multiple execution units of potentially different types, requires a DSE to be performed to find a highly optimal mapping betweek the inference operations and the hardware.
In this proposed approach the Y-graph approach is employed through the use of [OpenDSE](https://sdarg.github.io/opendse/) which also leverages [Opt4J](https://sdarg.github.io/opt4j/).

The original proof of concept work done as a master's thesis by Ines Ben Hmida can be found in the [InesDSE](InesDSE) folder.
