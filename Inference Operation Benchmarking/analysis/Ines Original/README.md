After a look (observations) of the collected data with an excel book, the following scripts were established to analyze the data:
	
	"type_impact.py": where the impact of changing the type of the input is scrutinized by establishing bar graphs of the average execution time versus the input type.
	
	"bar_graphs.py": Different functions to plot bar graphs to analyze the data.

	"data_analysis.py": where the linear regression cost models (of the average inference time versus the input size) are established.

	"fit_to_surface.py": where a trial to fit the data to a  surface (failed however because a good fit was not found) but might be improved.
