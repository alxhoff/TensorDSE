# ToDo's

### 1. Benchmarking
* [X] create and implement working Dockerfile (w Makefile) for a reproducible containerized environment
* [X] make adjustments to code according to new docker workflow
* [X] change output to `JSON`
* [X] fix issue with checking TPU usb address properly
* [X] Add CPU count to JSON Format
* [ ] GPU Deployment
  * Pro:
  [1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/52155#issuecomment-931498450)
  * Cons:

  - [X] Implement Function
  - [X] Adapt Dockerfile (custom GPU delegate build through bazel + git)
  - [ ] Test it out ssh server
    - sudo rights docker
* [ ] fix issue using tflite_runtime on conjunction with tflite
  - [Link](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/5709)
  - [X] Implemented a current hacky solution

<b> Questions </b>
</summary>

- [ ] isCPUAvailable, isTPUAvailable and isGPUAvailable, is solution good?
- [ ] how should `sudo modprobe usbmon` be implemented? Makefile? Show used solution!
- [ ] Is the cost model final?

<b> Ideas </b>
</summary>

- [ ] suppress stdout of unnecessary commands like the conversion itself
- [ ] use requirements.txt instead pip install
</details>

### 2. USB
- [X] change output to `JSON`
- [X] merge with analysis/cost calculations done in benchmarking
- [ ] reevaluate USB logic, reassure correctness
