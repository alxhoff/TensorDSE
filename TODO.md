# ToDo's

### 1. Benchmarking
* [X] create and implement working Dockerfile (w Makefile) for a reproducible containerized environment
* [X] make adjustments to code according to new docker workflow
* [X] change output to `JSON`
* [ ] fix `seg fault` but with use of tf instead of tflite_runtime

<b> Questions </b>
</summary>

- [ ] Is the cost model final?
- [X] Should the parent model (entire model) also be benchmarked or only its ops?
- [ ] isTPUAvailable, isCPUAvailable and isGPUAvailable, check with alex, bit tricky
- [ ] **Had to refactor and switch tflite_runtime for tf.lite**

- [ ] suppress stdout of unnecessary commands like the conversion itself
- [ ] use requirements.txt instead pip install
</details>

### 2. Implement GPU Deployment
- [X] Implement Function
- [ ] Adapt Dockerfile
- [ ] Test it out ssh server
  - need sudo rights to install bazel, its needed to build the GPU delegate
  - or at least docker rights to run a docker that installs bazel and does the rest
  - not getting bazel build right
